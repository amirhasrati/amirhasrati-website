      <p className="text-neutral-600">
        Ever since I first played Club Penguin on my dad’s old Sony VAIO, I’ve been passionate about computers. Fast
        forward 15 years, and I found myself pursuing a Bachelor of Computing degree at the University of Guelph. To my
        surprise, data structures turned out to be more challenging than following a NeetCode video on Two Sum. However,
        I’ve eagerly embraced the challenges of programming and now really enjoy the learning process. <br /> <br />
        In my free time, I’ve delved into web development, making it a significant focus. These days, I spend most of my
        time building new websites and web applications. Recently, I had the opportunity to design and build a website
        for a boutique financial planning firm. Meanwhile, I’m actively applying for full-stack software development
        positions in the hopes of gaining practical work experience. <br /> <br />
        When I’m not programming or studying for my courses, you’ll probably find me playing video games, going to the
        gym, or hanging out with my friends.
