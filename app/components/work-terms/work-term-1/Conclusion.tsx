        Before starting at Descartes, I was anxious to find out how my first work term experience was going to be like.
        What if I don't perform well? What if I'm not as skilled as my manager expected and can't do the work I'm
        assigned? What if... All of the overthinking and pessimistic thoughts made me feel out of place.

        In some ways, I think this shows how much I cared about this opportunity. I didn't want to waste it so I put
        everything I could into it. To my surprise, the stories I've heard from my friends about their negative
        experiences with their internships and managers didn't apply to me at all. I, and the other co-ops were
        immediately taken in as a part of the team, and throughout the semester, had the chance to work on and learn
        about what interested us.

        I honed and enhanced my web development skills, learned the importance and applications of cyber security in web
        applications, and worked on creating user-friendly and fluid interfaces. For a large portion of my work-term, I
        worked on implementing data visualization controls for our team. I refreshed our Pie, Bar, and Line chart
        controls and provided pages on the company demo application that demonstrate the implementation of these
        controls. I also worked on porting an old version of one of our applications to match our latest standards,
        including user-experience, styling, and moving over the app from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET Core 8.0. Overall,
        it was the ideal work term and I can't wait to be back at Descartes in the summer!
