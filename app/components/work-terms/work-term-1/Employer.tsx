        Descartes Systems Group is a Waterloo based company that was co-founded by co-ops from the University of
        Waterloo. They focus on providing highly scalable and secure logistics and supply chain productivity solutions
        to other businesses. Specifically, I interned with the Research and Development team (RANDD). RANDD is a very
        special team at Descartes. There is a huge co-op culture there, many full-time members of the team, coming out
        of co-op programs themselves, knew how to help us, the current co-ops, settle into the team and make the most of
        our work terms.
