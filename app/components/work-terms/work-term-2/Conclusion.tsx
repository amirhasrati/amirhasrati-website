        During my second work term at Descartes, I had the opportunity to take on more responsibility and contribute to
        a company-wide application used across the enterprise. I developed core features for the SSO Validation
        platform, which strengthened my understanding of security compliance in web applications, APIs, and identity
        providers. Beyond backend development, I worked closely with the UX department to design and refine UI
        components, improving user interaction flows and making the application more intuitive for developers across
        teams. This blend of technical development and cross-functional collaboration not only expanded my technical
        skillset in .NET Core, but also gave me valuable experience in creating software that balances functionality
        with usability. Overall, this term reinforced my passion for building impactful tools and showed me the
        importance of collaboration in delivering high-quality solutions.
