        This work term was truly amazing thanks to the "co-op wrangler" Timothy Nigh, my mentor Jess Cao, my manager
        Chris Behrendt, and I should literally name every other person on our team here as well because they probably
        helped me at some point or another (I actually did initially but I don't want to put everyones name online just
        in case they didn't want that). Thanks team!
